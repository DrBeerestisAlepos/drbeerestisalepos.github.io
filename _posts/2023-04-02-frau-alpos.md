Hello hoppy world! Frau Alpos is our first homebrew, and we are so excited about it!

### The beer
It is an American amber ale, rather bitter and very hoppy.

### The brewers
Beerestis, Jonas, Nicolas.

### The setup
Kudos to Nicolas for stealing a freaking huge cooking pot from his roommate, who is a cook and works in a restaurant. I am sure we gave that pot an invaluable and once-in-a-lifetime honor, to brew a beer in it!
It turned out the pot was actually too large for my stove, it didn't even properly fit, so we had to juggle a bit when mashing and boiling. And, since our fermenter anyway fits 7 liters, this was probably an overshot. We ended up with around 5 liters of beer.

### The result
Simply amazing! Well, ok, no, it was our first try, so we did not get everything right. Actually we made one mistake, we topped-up all the water we lost during boiling, while the recipe had already accounted for that (or some of that, because you are supposed to know precisely how much water evaporates during the boil). So we ended up with a rather light, and definitely watery beer. Instead of the expected 5.4% we got around 4%. That's quite some difference, huh? Anyhow, the beer was tasty, apart from this unlucky event. Really nice hoppy aroma and flavor.

### The name
The swiss post decided that I am lady, delivering the ingredients for the beer to Frau Alpos. That's all we needed...
